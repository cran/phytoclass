Description: Determine the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations of different 
    phytoplankton groups based on their pigment biomarkers. The method uses
    non-negative matrix factorisation and simulated annealing to minimise error
    between the observed and estimated values of pigment concentrations
    (Hayward et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/lom3.10541>).
    The approach is similar to the widely used 'CHEMTAX' program
    (Mackey et al. 1996) <doi:10.3354/meps144265>, but is more straightforward,
    accurate, and not reliant on initial guesses for the pigment to Chl a
    ratios for phytoplankton groups.
